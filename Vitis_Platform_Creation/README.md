# Platform Creation

Xilinx provides base platforms for Xilinx demo board for quick evaluation. To accomplish more in-depth development on Xilinx demo boards, or to develop on custom board, a custom platform needs to be created to support more interfaces. If a custom platform provides identical interfaces as Xilinx base platforms, the Vitis acceleration application can run on it with very few modifications.

This section introduces the platform creation basics and provides step-by-step tutorials for creating Vitis-AI ready platforms.
